It makes it quick and easy to express complex musical ideas, and can send and receive events from various different sources: MIDI, OSC, SocketIO, and .mid files. What isobar does The core objective of isobar is to provide a framework for sequencing and triggering events, which may be MIDI messages, OSC events, triggers for third-party DSP engines such as SuperCollider , or even Python functions. ( What types of event are supported? ) It can be used to trigger events in real time, or to generate patterns that can be serialised as MIDI files and loaded into a DAW. It can sync to external clocks, or act as a clock source to external devices. It can also load patterns serialised in MIDI files for processing. What isobar doesn't do isobar does not generate any audio on its own. It must be configured to send events to an output device which is responsible for sound synthesis. Basic concepts There are a few key components in isobar. The Timeline handles timing and scheduling, triggering events at the correct moment. It is made up of multiple Tracks, which normally . It can maintain its own clock with millisecond accuracy, or sync to an external clock. Events correspond to triggers that are typically sent to output devices or received from input devices. These may be MIDI notes, control changes, OSC triggers, and other general types. An event is typically described by a dict with a number of properties. For example: { \"note\" : 60, \"amplitude\": 127 } Patterns : Each of the properties of an event can be specified by a Pattern, which generates a sequence of return values. Simple pattern types generate fixed sequences, random values, or values based on statistical models. Patterns can be passed other patterns as parameters, so they can operate on each other -- for example, causing an input pattern to loop N times, or skipping the input values with some probability. Devices : Events are sent to output devices, over interfaces such as MIDI or OSC. Events can also be received and processed.

On Linux, the libasound and libjack-dev packages are also required: apt install libasound2-dev libjack-dev 1. Install isobar The simplest way to install isobar is via pip : pip3 install isobar To download the examples, you will need to clone the repo and install from source: git clone https : // github . com / ideoforms / isobar . git cd isobar pip3 install . 2. Set up an output device The example scripts are based on sending MIDI to a DAW or MIDI-compatible hardware instrument. By default, isobar uses the system's default MIDI output as its output device. If you want to specify a non-standard MIDI output, you can specify the name of the MIDI device when creating the Timeline , or set a global default output device by using an environmental variable: export ISOBAR_DEFAULT_MIDI_OUT = \"Prophet 6\" When you run an example script, you can confirm that it is using the right output as it will print the name of the output device it is using. 3. Run an example Inside the repo directory you cloned above, there are a number of example scripts. To run the \"hello world\" example: python3 examples / 00. ex - hello - world . py The script will print the default MIDI driver to screen, and begin triggering notes. Troubleshooting If you don't hear any notes, check that: the name of the correct device is printed to the console your device is configured to listen for MIDI on channel 1, and can play the note 60 Use a MIDI monitor utility to check that the events are registering correctly.

The gate key specifies what proportion of this interval the note will be sustained for (and defaults to 1.0, for seamless legato). For instance: #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Play a note every beat, sustained for half a beat #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- timeline . schedule ({ \"note\" : 60 \"duration\" : 1 , \"gate\" : 0.5 }) The gate can also be greater than 1, to hold a note down as the next note begins: #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Play a sustained, overlapping chord, with each note lasting for 4 beats #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- timeline . schedule ({ \"note\" : iso . PSequence ([ 60 , 64 , 67 , 72 ], 1 ), \"duration\" : 0.5 , \"gate\" : 8 }) Keys and Scales isobar has builtin objects representing musical keys and scales. Scale encapsulates an ordered set of semitones. Named scales are defined corresponding to commonly-used scales ( major , minor , chromatic , aeolian , etc). Key encapsulates a Scale with a specified tonic. Warning isobar currently only supports equal temperament tuning. Keys and scales can be used in events by using the degree key to look up a specific degree within the key/scale. transpose and octave can be used to transpose by semitones and octaves respectively. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Play an F minor arpeggio #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- timeline . schedule ({ \"degree\" : iso . PSequence ([ 0 , 2 , 4 , 7 ], 1 ), \"key\" : iso .

PSequence ([ ( 0 , 1 , 4 ), ( 1 , 4 , 6 ), ( 3 , 4 , 7 ), ( - 1 , 0 , 4 ), ]), \"octave\" : 4 , \"duration\" : 2 }) You can also specify different amplitudes or gates for notes of a chord by passing tuples of the same length: timeline . schedule ({ \"note\" : iso . PSequence ([ ( 60 , 62 , 67 ), ]), \"gate\" : iso . PSequence ([ ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 ) ]), \"amplitude\" : iso .

A pattern is a Python iterator , which is to say it does two things: generates and returns the next item in the sequence when no more items are available in the sequence, raises a StopIteration exception >>> seq = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ], 1 ) >>> next ( seq ) 1 >>> next ( seq ) 2 >>> next ( seq ) 3 >>> next ( seq ) Traceback ( most recent call last ): File \"sequence.py\" , line 46 , in __next__ raise StopIteration StopIteration Note that this means that patterns can't seek backwards in time. Their only concern is generating the next event. By assigning patterns to properties of events , you can specify sequences of values to control any aspect of the control output: pitch, velocity, duration, etc. Patterns can be finite, such as the example above, or infinite, in which case they will keep generating new values forever. Patterns can also typically generate different Python types. Some Pattern classes will seek to do the right thing based on whether they are passed them int or float arguments. PSequence([ \"apple\", \"pear\" ]) generates an alternating pair of strings PWhite(0, 10) generates a stream of ints between [0 .. 9] PWhite(0.0, 10.0) generates a stream of floats between [0.0 .. 10.0] PChoice([ Key(\"C\", \"major\"), Key(\"A\", \"minor\") ]) picks one of the specified Key s at random Pattern resolution When a pattern returns a pattern, the embedded pattern will also be resolved recursively. For example: PChoice([ PSequence([0, 2, 3]), PSequence([7, 5, 2 ]) ]) each step, picks one of the embedded patterns and returns its next value Pattern operators Patterns can be combined and modified using standard Python arithmetic operators, with other patterns or with scalar values. >>> added = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) + 10 >>> next ( added ) 11 >>> next ( added ) 12 >>> multiplied = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) * 4 >>> next ( multiplied ) 4 >>> next ( multiplied ) 8 >>> inverted = 12 - iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> next ( inverted ) 11 >>> next ( inverted ) 10 combined = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) + iso . PSequence ([ 12 , 0 , 12 ]) >>> next ( combined ) 13 >>> next ( combined ) 2 The operators are designed to do what you would expect: binary operators ( + , - , * , / , % , << , >> ) perform the operation on each item of the input patterns. Note that, for binary operators, if either of the inputs returns None , the output value becomes None . equality operators ( < , > , == , != ) can be used to do element-wise comparison on the input sequences, returning a pattern whose values are either True , False or None . abs() can be used to generate the absolute values of a sequence For finite sequences, len() will return the length of the sequence A float pattern can be turned into an int pattern with isobar.PInt(pattern) Duplicating patterns It's often useful to be able to apply the same pattern to multiple properties or events. However, this can result in unwanted behaviours as shown below: >>> a = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> d = iso . PDict ({ \"p1\" : a , \"p2\" : a }) >>> next ( d ) { 'p1' : 1 , 'p2' : 2 } Because the \"p1\" and \"p2\" properties both refer to the same instance, the next() method is called twice on a . Instead, use a.copy() to create a duplicate with identical state: >>> a = iso . PSequence ([ 1 , 2 , 3 ]) >>> d = iso . PDict ({ \"p1\" : a . copy (), \"p2\" : a . copy () }) >>> next ( d ) { 'p1' : 1 , 'p2' : 1 } Resetting a pattern To rewind a pattern to its initial state, call pattern.reset() . This restores all state variables to their original values. Stochastic patterns Stochastic patterns each have their own independent random number generator state. This allows them to be seeded with a known value to create repeatable pseudo-random number sequences. >>> a = iso . PWhite ( 0 , 10 ) >>> a . seed ( 123 ) >>> a . nextn ( 16 ) [ 0 , 0 , 4 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 0 , 4 , 0 ] >>> a . seed ( 123 ) >>> a . nextn ( 16 ) [ 0 , 0 , 4 , 1 , 9 , 0 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 1 , 3 , 3 , 2 , 0 , 4 , 0 ] Static patterns The state of a regular pattern steps forward each time the next() method is called. The state of a static pattern, conversely, is not modified by a call to next() . This means that next() may be called multiple times and return the same value each time. Static pattern classes include: PStaticPattern : When called as PStaticPattern(pattern, duration) , wraps a regular pattern and returns a new static pattern. Each new value of the inner pattern is returned for a specified duration in beats (see example below). The duration parameter may also be a pattern. PCurrentTime : Returns the current Timeline's time, in beats. PGlobals : See Globals . Static patterns can be used to impose temporal structure on a piece. For example, to modulate over a set of keys: #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Create a pattern which is an alternating pair of Keys. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- key_sequence = iso . PSequence ([ iso . Key ( \"C\" , \"minor\" ), iso . Key ( \"G\" , \"major\" ), ]) #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- # Create a static pattern embeds the key_sequence pattern. # Each value will be held for 4 beats before progressing to the next value. #-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- key_static = iso .
