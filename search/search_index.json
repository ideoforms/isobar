These may be MIDI notes, control changes, OSC triggers, and other general types. An event is typically described by a dict with a number of properties. For example: <code>{ \"note\" : 60, \"amplitude\": 127 }</code></li> <li>Patterns: Each of the properties of an event can be specified by a Pattern, which generates a sequence of return values. Simple pattern types generate fixed sequences, random values, or values based on statistical models. Patterns can be passed other patterns as parameters, so they can operate on each other -- for example, causing an input pattern to loop N times, or skipping the input values with some probability.  </li> <li>Devices: Events are sent to output devices, over interfaces such as MIDI or OSC.
