# About the project

isobar was first designed for the generative sound installation [Variable 4](http://www.variable4.org.uk), in which it was used to generate musical structures in response to changing weather conditions. It was more recently used in [The Listening Machine](http://www.thelisteningmachine.org/), taking live input from Twitter and generating musical output from language patterns, streamed live over the internet.

Many of the concepts behind Pattern and its subclasses are inspired by the brilliant pattern library of the [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/) synthesis language.
